# Short-Read Illumina Alignment Pipeline, Paired-End

The paired-end short-read alignment pipeline for Illumina data follows the Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) Best Practices. It is designed for per-sample and per-library execution, handling one or multiple sets of paired FASTQ files. The pipeline is optimized for distributed processing, requiring each pair of FASTQ files to correspond to a single sequencing lane.

## Key Pipeline Steps

1. **Alignment with BWA-MEM:** Initial alignment of the raw reads to the reference genome using BWA-MEM.
2. **Read Groups Assignment:** Assignment of reads to specific groups, providing essential information for subsequent steps.
3. **Duplicates Marking:** Identification and labeling of duplicate reads, that originated during library preparation or as sequencing artifacts.
4. **Base Quality Score Recalibration (BQSR):** Recalibration of base quality scores, including indels, resulting in the generation of a refined, analysis-ready BAM file.

## Sentieon Software and Distributed Mode

To meet the scalability demands, especially with high-coverage whole-genome sequencing data, the pipeline utilizes a more efficient software implementation from [Sentieon](https://www.sentieon.com/).

Sentieon offers a comprehensive toolkit (DNASeq[^1]) that replicates the original BWA and GATK algorithms, while enhancing computational efficiency. The pipeline also leverage Sentieonâ€™s [distributed mode](https://support.sentieon.com/appnotes/distributed_mode/) to streamline the processing of large data volumes.

The distributed version of the pipeline operates on reads divided by sequencing lanes and parallelizing some of the processing across multiple genomic regions, defined as shards. This implementation is a 1 to 1 equivalent to a standard implementation of the pipeline, producing identical results.
